# Coursera_Robotics_Estimatio_and_Learning
The answer copy form the git/with my own work.
The Week? is my homework download from the Coursera.
The week?/.zip is the original file and the discompression files are my own work.
However The Coursera-Robotics-Estimation-and-Learning-master is the answer clone from the git and all the submit answers are full marks.
